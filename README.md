## About this fork

This software version is based on Mesen2 by Sour.

This software version is based on Mesen2 from Sour. The main focus is on the emulation of a NES/Famicom game, which is why all setting options that are not directly related to the pure gaming experience have been removed. When the application is started, the pre-selected (supplied) NES/Famicom game is automatically started and executed.
